                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Siddhartha Banerjee. I am currently a 1st year undergraduate student pursuing my B. Tech in Computer 
                    Science and Engineering from Institute of Engineering and Management, Newtown. I am a passionate and driven student with a deep interest in technology, innovation, and research. 
                    I enjoy tackling new challenges, learning continuously, and applying knowledge to real-world problems. 
                    Ever since I laid my hands on a computer for the first time, I was always fascinated about how these machines were designed 
                    in such intricate ways to help mankind progress further towards the future. Since then, I have embarked on a journey to learn
                    everything there is to know about computers, programs, websites, apps and much more. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence and 
                    Machine Learning, and seeing the rapid developments in the field of AI, I also want to fully grasp the concepts of AI and Machine 
                    Learning, and with the help of all these and similar like-minded colleagues, I want to build projects and products that would contribute
                    positively to the society and make the lives of the common mass more simpler!

                <p>
                    Although I do not have formal work or internship experience, I have gained significant practical knowledge through academic projects, research, and coursework. My focus has been on building a solid foundation in Computer Science, and I am eager to apply my skills in real-world environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked extensively on personal and academic projects that reflect my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. Please refer to the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> section for more details on my work and achievements.

                    I don't have any prior paper/patent publications currently. However, I am currently working on an exciting Arduino-based project with four other first-year students from my class. We intend to focus our project on a societal cause - one that would benefit the society and make their lives simpler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If our project meets the technical criteria and is approved by our faculty, we plan to submit it for a patent application. This project is an incredible learning experience, and it allows us to apply our theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay tuned for updates on our progress and the potential patent submission!
